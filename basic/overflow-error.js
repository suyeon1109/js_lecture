/* 1. Rounding Error

In JavaScript, a floating point number has a limited precision of 64 bits
which is about 16 digits. This can cause rounding off errors. Uncomment the 
first code segment to see this in action.

To uncomment a whole section - highlight the section and hit Shift (or Command) 
+ the "/" key.

Values smaller than the minimum are stored as 0, and values larger than the 
maximum are stored as +/- Infinity.
